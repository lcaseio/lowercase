# UI Workspace Initiative — Arc: Documentation reorganization (Change C36)

**Previous:** [Replay](./replay.md) (Changes C35, C37) · **Next:** [Flow authoring](./flow-authoring.md) (Change C38)

Part of the [`INITIATIVE.md`](../INITIATIVE.md) Change log, split out to keep that doc scannable. Continues from [`replay.md`](./replay.md). Continues in [`replay.md`](./replay.md) (Change C37, returning to that arc rather than this one). A meta/process Change, not UI-substance work — this is the Change that actually builds the `docs/initiatives/` structure every other arc file in this directory is an example of.

## Change C36 - Documentation reorganization - merged (PR #319)

Split this initiative doc into a repeatable per-initiative structure, before it grows past a comfortable size again.

### Discussion

**The problem, concretely**: this file already needed a Changes-1–8 archive split once, and had grown back to ~800 lines since. That's not a one-time cleanup, it's a recurring cost of the format itself — a single ever-growing living doc for an entire initiative's full history. This Change is a meta/process change, not UI-substance work: build a repeatable structure so this doesn't recur, and prove it out for real by migrating _this_ initiative into it now (not deferring to the next one) — the user's own framing: "its some churn but actually useful in extending what I'm building now and shows the pattern."

**Not an ADR.** Considered writing the convention as an ADR (mirroring ADR-0001's own dual role — documents the ADR convention and is one), but rejected: ADR-0004's own sequencing precedent (written only after Change C6/7 validated the shape in practice, not before) argues against freezing this before it's actually been used once. It's a plain, living `docs/initiatives/README.md` instead; revisit ADR-ifying it only after this migration (and maybe one more initiative) has used it for real.

**The shape:**

```
docs/
  todo.md / adr/ / request-flow-map.md / observability.md   <- stay top-level, cross-cutting, untouched
  initiatives/
    README.md                              <- initiative index (order = start/scaffold order) + the convention below
    ui-workspace/
      INITIATIVE.md
      sims-mode.md                         <- was UI_SIMS_MODE.md, unreformatted
      artifacts-mode.md                    <- was UI_ARTIFACTS_MODE.md, unreformatted
      research/
        state-management.md                <- was UI_STATE_RESEARCH.md
      arcs/
        explorer-foundation.md             <- Changes C1-C8 (was the old ARCHIVE.md). The old "Global workspace / navigation direction" section's origin-story half moved into this file's intro; its durable heuristics moved to INITIATIVE.md's own Design principles section instead.
        right-panel-rail.md                <- Changes C9-C13
        runs-and-sims-in-the-tree.md        <- Changes C14, C15, 18 (18 bundles here, not with 16-17 — it continues Sims' own thread, not EventGraph's)
        event-graph.md                      <- Changes C16, C17
        panel-icons-and-nav-rail.md         <- Changes C19, C20
        artifacts-in-explorer.md            <- Changes C21-C24 (named distinctly from the satellite artifacts-mode.md — different, earlier body of work)
        run-input-params.md                 <- Changes C25, C26
        expand-content.md                   <- Changes C27, C28
        flow-graph-visual-rework.md         <- Changes C29-C34
        replay.md                           <- Change C35
        documentation-reorganization.md     <- Change C36, this file
    evals/
      INITIATIVE.md                          <- just Summary + Not yet scoped, scaffolded now even though work hasn't started
      eval-initiative.md                     <- was EVAL_INITIATIVE.md
      eval-research.md                      <- was EVAL_RESEARCH.md, distilled later (see below), not moved verbatim
      arcs/                                 <- empty until real Changes exist
```

**What stays top-level and why**: things that outlive any single push — a bug found during this UI initiative is equally relevant during the next one, an ADR is a durable decision independent of which initiative produced it. Nothing about this reorganization touches them.

**Why migrate the current initiative now instead of starting the pattern with the next one**: doing it now means there's a real, working example to literally copy when starting `evals/`, not just a convention described in the abstract. Chosen despite the real churn — decided, not a default.

**`INITIATIVE.md`'s section skeleton** — omit a section entirely until it has real content, never an empty stub: `Summary` (merges the old Summary + "Overall idea and purpose"; also where the flow-version→dockview-workspace pivot gets named in prose — the doc's own title stays untouched on purpose, same as this doc never rewrites past design bullets to hide a pivot), `Current state` (was "What's already built" + the Sims/Artifacts pointers), `Design principles` (the surviving heuristics from "Global workspace / navigation direction" — picker-vs-browse, tree-position disambiguation, list-scale-via-search-not-tree, etc.), `Change index`, `Next up`, `Not yet scoped` (merges "Other bits of work" + "Candidate next chunks" + both "Further out" sections into one place instead of four scattered headings).

**Satellite docs — two legitimate categories, not one:**

1. `research/<topic>.md` — pre-decision investigation, organized by question not by Change, an ongoing category (not just an ADR-precursor).
2. Pre-log sub-history (`sims-mode.md`, `artifacts-mode.md`) — self-contained, already-merged Change sequences (#265–269, #272–283) that finished entirely _before_ this initiative's own log started (both predate Change C1, #284). Can't join the Change index without a number collision, regardless of how Change-chunked their own prose is internally — Artifacts mode's later entries (Change C4c on) already read almost exactly like an arc entry, kept unreformatted anyway since the numbering problem alone settles it. Stay flat siblings of `INITIATIVE.md`, not nested in `arcs/`. This category is closed by construction — nothing new can predate a log that already exists.

**One Change entry, fixed shape, heading depth contextual (one level below whatever's directly above — `##` in a standalone arc file, `###` if nested inside `INITIATIVE.md`'s own section), never the old `####` carried over out of habit:**

```markdown
## Change N - <Title> - <not started | in progress | merged (#N) | skipped>

<1-2 sentence framing>

### Discussion

[settled decisions, deferred items, rejected alternatives — only if real]

### What actually landed

[matches design, or the deltas]
```

Only `Discussion` and `What actually landed` are real headings — genuine per-entry anchors present in nearly every Change. Everything more occasional (rejected alternatives, explicitly-deferred items, bugs found along the way) stays a bold lead-in nested inside one of those two, not its own heading. Omit `Discussion` for a Change simple enough not to need it. No date anywhere by default, header or body — add one only when it's genuinely disambiguating, never by imitating whichever prior entry happened to have one. (This file's own history: an inline date first crept into Change C29's body, spread into several "Further out" notes after it, then became header-level once Change C35/36's discussions grew long enough to need their own floating section, separated from their own Change's `merged (#N)` marker — a structural cause, which this fixed, single-section template removes at the root rather than needing a separate rule to police.)

**Skipped Changes — default is in-place, own number kept.** `skipped` as the entry's own status, `What actually landed` renamed `Why skipped`, no renumbering cascade — the goal is to actively reorder the still-forecast sequence _before_ anything downstream becomes real, so this is the common case, same operation `Next up` already performs on every reorder. Only when a number is already unfreeable (real precedent: Change C8 was going to be "Workspaces," but Changes C9+ already existed by the time it was cancelled) does it move to a dedicated `Skipped or superseded` section in `INITIATIVE.md`, labeled `Change (originally N, no longer planned)` — and it never gets a row in the Change index table, since its number belongs to whatever real Change N actually is now.

**Plan Mode's own implementation-plan output is never archived anywhere.** `Discussion` already settles the why beforehand, `What actually landed` captures the real result afterward — the plan itself is bulk sitting between two things already deliberately kept, the same shape of problem as an undistilled research dump.

**Evals gets scaffolded as its own initiative now, not left as a section in this doc.** `EVAL_RESEARCH.md` is a raw, unedited LLM chat copy-paste (confirmed directly — opens "Yes — this is exactly the right shape for your engine," with bracket-style citations) and needs real distillation, not a verbatim move. Bundled into this Change rather than its own, staged: trimmed by the user first, then distilled for real into `evals/eval-research.md`.

**The arc split for Changes C9–C28 is resolved, not deferred to execution** — governing principle: **narrative relatedness, not a fixed Change-count-per-file rule**: group Changes whose story is genuinely one continuous arc told in installments; leave a Change to its own file when it's genuinely standalone. Final shape (see the tree above): Changes C14/15/18 together (18 continues Sims' own thread from 15, not EventGraph's from 16-17); 16/17 on their own; 19/20 on their own, split from 21-24 (Artifacts mode is its own coherent four-Change story and doesn't need 19/20's unrelated panel-icon/nav-rail work bundled in); 25/26 on their own, split from 27/28 (run-input-params and expand-content are two different features that happen to be numerically adjacent, not one story).

**`arcs/` filenames are descriptive, never numbered.** No `01-`/`02-` prefix — the Change index table is what makes "which file has Change C16" answerable, not filesystem sort order. Numbered prefixes would also fight the "group by relatedness, not fixed count" principle, since inserting a rediscovered arc later would force renumbering.

**The Change index table — lives inside `INITIATIVE.md`, near the top, not a separate file.** A markdown table (style matches this repo's own `README.md` package table — aligned pipes, short phrases), one row per Change number, covering _all_ Changes from 1 through current, not just archived ones:

| Change  | Description                                          | Status        | Where                      |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------- |
| 9   | Right Panel Icon Rail (Params/Sim migrated first)    | merged (PR #292) | `arcs/right-panel-rail.md` |
| 16  | EventGraph, spawned from the Flow Graph panel itself | merged (PR #299) | `arcs/event-graph.md`      |
| 35  | Flow graph replay for completed runs                 | merged (PR #318) | `arcs/replay.md`           |

Columns, in order of how essential they are:

- **Change** and **Description** — description is the same density already used in every existing Change Log header, not a new, longer summary. Deliberately no separate "longer summary" tier beyond this.
- **Status** — reuse the exact string each entry's own header already carries (`merged (PR #292)`, `skipped`, etc.) verbatim, not a new format.
- **Where** — the `arcs/` (or satellite) file containing the full entry. No content ever stays inline in `INITIATIVE.md` itself, even while a Change is still in progress — this is the field that makes a non-numbered filename convention work at all.
- **See also** (fifth column, added only to rows that need it, blank on most) — a genuinely optional pointer to a non-obvious related Change, e.g. Change C35's row would list "Change C16 (EventGraph singleton design)". Carries only a pointer, never the reasoning. Populating this for Changes C1–C35 retroactively is a real, bounded writing task — natural to do while reading each entry closely during the archive move anyway, not a separate pass.

**On Change numbers vs. GitHub PR numbers — deliberately kept as two separate, parallel systems, not unified.** The GitHub number is assigned atomically the instant a Change is actually opened, is a repo-wide counter shared with unrelated work, and can't be predicted or reserved in advance. This doc's own "Change N" is an initiative-relative planning sequence, assigned as soon as a unit of work is named as its own thing — its value is being a clean, gap-free, initiative-scoped ordering, which trying to rename to match GitHub's numbers after the fact would destroy. Keep recording both together at merge time, exactly as already done (`- merged (PR #318)`).

**Scope of this Change, concretely:**

- Create `docs/initiatives/`, write `docs/initiatives/README.md` (the convention above, plus an initiative-order index table).
- Move `UI_WORKSPACE_INITIATIVE.md` → `docs/initiatives/ui-workspace/INITIATIVE.md`, rebuilt into the section skeleton above.
- Move `UI_SIMS_MODE.md`/`UI_ARTIFACTS_MODE.md` in unreformatted; move+rename `UI_STATE_RESEARCH.md` → `research/state-management.md`.
- Move/rename the existing Changes C1–C8 archive (`UI_WORKSPACE_MILESTONE_ARCHIVE.md`) into `arcs/explorer-foundation.md`; split Changes C9–C34 into the eight `arcs/` files listed in the tree above.
- Build the Change index table (Changes C1 through current, with `See also`) inside `INITIATIVE.md`, near the top.
- Scaffold `docs/initiatives/evals/` (`INITIATIVE.md` with just `Summary` + `Not yet scoped`); move+rename `EVAL_INITIATIVE.md`/`EVAL_RESEARCH.md` in; distill the latter's content for real once the user has trimmed it.
- Update every relative link/cross-reference this move touches — the pointer lines this main doc already has for archived Changes, any reference from `docs/todo.md`, and check memory for any stored path to the old file location.
- Explicitly out of scope: no UI-workspace substance/code changes at all — purely a documentation/organization change. `docs/todo.md`, `docs/adr/`, `docs/request-flow-map.md`, `docs/observability.md` untouched.

### What actually landed

The design above landed essentially as planned — the full `docs/initiatives/` tree, all 36 Change entries (1 through 35, plus this one) reformatted to the `## Change N` / `### Discussion` / `### What actually landed` template, `docs/initiatives/README.md` written, `evals/` scaffolded — plus a few real decisions and deltas made during execution, not settled at design time:

- **Reformat scope, confirmed rather than assumed**: the design's own template section already implied Changes C1–C35 should all be reformatted, but the "scope of this Change" bullets and effort estimate only explicitly covered 9–34. Confirmed with the user before starting: yes, reformat Changes C1–C8 and Change C35 too, for consistency across every arc file rather than leaving two visibly older-shaped exceptions.
- **The "Global workspace" section's origin-story half didn't fully relocate as planned.** The design said it would move into `explorer-foundation.md`'s own intro; in practice it was condensed into a shorter note inside `INITIATIVE.md`'s `Summary` instead (the pivot itself — "started as a flow-version-scoped idea, settled into a dockview panel/tree shell" — is still named, just not with the full original Postman-research narrative alongside it). A real scope trim, not an oversight; worth expanding later if the fuller narrative is missed.
- **Change C38/39/41's "Further out" write-ups stayed in `Not yet scoped` rather than becoming their own `arcs/` files.** They have real substance and assigned numbers in `Next up`, but no actual Change has started yet — arc files are for narrated build history, not pre-work staging, so this was a deliberate line to hold rather than over-scope the move.
- **`eval-research.md`'s distillation happened as part of this Change, once the user's own trim was in hand** — removing residual "you"-addressed phrasing, a broken numbered list left over from trimming, one section still shaped like raw chat output (bare type names in code fences), typos, and non-ASCII curly quotes throughout. A first attempt at the curly-quote cleanup used a `sed` character-class substitution that corrupted the file's multi-byte characters into garbage bytes — caught immediately, the file was rewritten cleanly from the pre-corruption version with every fix reapplied by hand, verified byte-clean afterward.
- **The cross-reference sweep found a few more mentions than the initial repo-wide search estimated** (`docs/todo.md` in particular), and 13 personal-memory files needed the same path updates, not the ~11 originally flagged — both fixed as part of the same pass, not treated as a separate follow-up.
- **One memory got a real content revision, not just a path fix**: `project_milestone_doc_dual_purpose_tension` described the exact human-narrative-vs-AI-context-density tension this Change resolves, and previously said not to propose a fix unprompted. Updated to record that the tension is now resolved (by this Change) rather than leaving it as an open question a future session might still tiptoe around.
- **Verification**: `pnpm typecheck` (25/25 packages), `pnpm lint` (26/26), and `apps/web-app`'s vitest suite (278/278 tests) all passed clean; every touched code file's diff was confirmed by eye to be comment/string-only, no logic changes. A repo-wide grep for every old filename returned zero hits afterward, aside from this entry's own intentional "was X.md" migration notes.
- `docs/UI_WORKSPACE_INITIATIVE.md` and the other five old top-level docs were removed via `git rm -f` only after confirming every section had a real new home — nothing was committed as part of this work; that was left for the user to do themselves.
