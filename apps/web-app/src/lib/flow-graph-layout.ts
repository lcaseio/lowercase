// dagre+React-Flow gotcha this file used to warn about generically; this
// keeps the two in lockstep by construction instead of by convention.
// Exported so FlowStepNode.tsx can space its rendered <Handle>s using the
// exact same unit dagre sized the node's growth with -- same drift-avoidance
// reasoning as FIT_VIEW_OPTIONS above. Wide enough that TB's flat (unrotated)
