// Real integration test against a live Redis instance -- gated on

// delivery carries the same conversation an in-process mailbox does, and a
// fake cannot establish that. Run `docker compose up -d redis` and copy
// .env.test.local.example to .env.test.local (loaded automatically, see
// tests/setup-env.ts) to exercise this locally; CI provides the var directly
// via the workflow's redis service.
//
// The point of the test is what it does *not* change: it hands
// buildHttpJobGraph a different carrier and asserts the same things
// job.slice.test.ts asserts in-process. Engine, Worker and Observability
// are constructed identically and know nothing about either.
