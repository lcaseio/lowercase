 * one arrangement. This fixture answers that: four roles, a topic two roles
 * publish, a subscription spanning two topics, and a role that consumes nothing
 * at all.
 *
 * Event types are borrowed from the real map because `Topic` requires real
 * ones. Nothing here corresponds to a real conversation.
