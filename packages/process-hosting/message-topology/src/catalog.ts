/**
 * Every topic and logical subscription a product declares, independent of any
 * deployment that enables them or any process that hosts one.
 *
 * A catalog is the stable vocabulary: identities and the Message types each
 * carries. It says nothing about which carrier moves them, which physical
 * route they travel, or which process role consumes a subscription. A deployment
 * manifest answers all three by selecting from here.
 *
 * Closed under union, which is what makes one protocol's declarations a catalog
 * in their own right. `jobCatalog` is the job conversation's contribution and
 * happens to be the whole of it today only because it is the sole migrated
 * protocol. The dormant `worker.slot.*` protocol and the run and step families
 * still on `EventBusPort` merge in rather than replacing it, and
 * `assertDistinctTopics` is what makes that merge safe: two protocols reusing
 * one identity is the failure a union has to catch.
 *
 * Shaped identically to the router's `MessageRouterTopology` on purpose, so a
 * catalog can still be handed straight to a carrier while the two layers are
 * being separated.
