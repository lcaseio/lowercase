 * The Worker-Engine job conversation, declared as delivery purposes rather than
 * transport. Nothing here names a mailbox, a Redis stream key, a consumer
 * name, or an acknowledgement -- a log-backed carrier consumes these same
 * declarations.
 *
 * The conversation is jobs, not one capability. `httpjson` is the only
 * protocol its Message types name today, and an `mcp` job belongs on these
 * same topics rather than on a parallel set. The type unions are what keep
 * that honest: `defineTopicFor` proves each list covers its union exactly, so
 * adding a type to `JobCommandType` without listing it on the topic fails to
 * compile rather than silently never being published.
