/**
 * Compile-time proof that the Postgres client satisfies every repository seam.
 *
 * Nothing constructs a Postgres client yet, so without this file the claim that
 * these repositories are provider-portable would rest on a document rather than
 * on the build. The failure it exists to catch is quiet: someone reaches for
 * `groupBy` or `mode: "insensitive"` in a shared repository, the SQLite build
 * stays green because the seam is typed against SQLite, and the break only
 * surfaces whenever a Postgres client is finally wired up.
 *
 * Why this works at all: SQLite's generated input types are a strict subset of
 * Postgres's, and method parameters are contravariant, so a seam typed against
 * SQLite accepts either client while a seam typed against Postgres would accept
 * only Postgres. See
 * docs/initiatives/swappable-infrastructure/research/prisma-provider-type-seam-spike.md.
 *
 * This is not a test file -- vitest's `tests/{@literal **}/*.test.[jt]s` glob skips it and it
 * has no runtime behaviour to run. It is picked up by tsconfig.typecheck.json,
 * which includes `tests`, and excluded from the build, which includes only
 * `src`. It fails `pnpm typecheck`, naming the offending seam.
