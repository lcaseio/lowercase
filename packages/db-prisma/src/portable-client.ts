/**
 * A client either provider can supply.

 * `SqlClient` is the seam a repository states as a *parameter*: each one narrows
 * it to the handful of methods that repository calls. This is the other side --
 * what composition *provides*, one value that satisfies all of those seams at
 * once. Both are derived from the SQLite client, so their members are identical
 * rather than merely compatible.
 *
 * Typed against SQLite because that is the narrower of the two, which is what
 * makes the Postgres client satisfy it. See
 * `docs/initiatives/swappable-infrastructure/research/prisma-provider-type-seam-spike.md`.
 *
 * The assignment at each construction site is the parity check, so there is no
 * separate assertion: `packages/runtime`'s `buildSqlClient` and
 * `packages/test-support`'s `createPostgresTestDb` both assign a concrete client
 * to this type with no cast, and either compile or do not.
