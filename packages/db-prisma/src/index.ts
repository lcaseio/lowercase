/**
 * The provider-neutral seam. `SqlClient` is concretely the SQLite client type,
 * and that asymmetry is the design: SQLite's generated input types are a strict
 * subset of Postgres's, and method parameters are contravariant, so a seam
 * typed against SQLite is satisfied by either client while the reverse is not.
 * Typing repositories against this is what keeps shared code inside the subset
 * both providers support, enforced at compile time.
 *
 * See docs/initiatives/swappable-infrastructure/research/prisma-provider-type-seam-spike.md.
 *
 * Code that needs a concrete client -- to construct one, or to name a provider
 * deliberately -- imports `@lcase/db-prisma/sqlite` or `@lcase/db-prisma/postgres`.
